# AccessB-KiCAD-files

This KiCAD project was made with KiCAD version 4.0.7.

The schematic and PCB design are NOT final, I need to make some changes:

*Change the footprint of the PIC, from SOIC_28_narrow to SOIC_28_Wide
*Relocate C3, this because PICkit 3 programmer hit it when is inserted on ICSP jumper
*Change and add silk screen notes on the PCB.
*a LOT of other things that I'm sure will appear....
